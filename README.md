# jojo-gpt2-bot

## Overview

In this project I trained a quote generator using GPT2.

This bot was made to be interfaced with an online chat so that people can use it to generate text in the style of lines from the animated Japanese telivision series "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure", known for its unique and over-the-top writing.

This project was origionally completed on the 3rd of September 2022 (prior to the release of ChatGPT).

## Training

The training procedure for English and Japanese is outlined in the Jupyter notebooks, which may be found in the `notebooks` directory.

Training data needs to be obtained separately from Netflix via [language reactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/) from the show JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
